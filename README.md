This project was intended to simulate a real life Vending Machine. I made this project with create-react-app.

In the project directory, you can run:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

## Instructions to use the machine:

-Then you select what item you want to buy based on the prices listed on the machine
-You press Enter and the product will fall in the square below the machine.
